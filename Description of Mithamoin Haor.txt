This project is based on Mithamoin Haor scenario. In this project, we will be drawing Mithamoin Haor which is located at Kishoreganj. There will be a road where cars and Bicycles can move from left to right or right to left. Fish will jump along with the water flow. The boat will move from one point to another point. After Sunset, the light will be ‘turn on’ in the light-house. There are two modes in this project one is the day other one is the 'night mode'. In this scenario, the moon and the star will rise at night.
